## Quotes

- Truth springs from argument amongst friends.
- Iceland is the place you go to remind yourself that planet Earth is a machine: very large, continuously operating, working on a time scale too long to easily observe, towards a highly uncertain end; and to remind yourself that all the organic life that has ever existed amounts to a greasy film that has survived on the exterior of that machine thanks to furious improvisation rather than any specific dispensation.
- I always thought that inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. [Chuck Close]
- The truth is rarely pure and never simple. [Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest - Act I]
- And she told me about a youth who had fallen in love with a planet. He stood by the sea, stretched out his arms and prayed to the planet, dreamed of it, and directed all his thoughts to it. But he knew, or felt he knew, that a star cannot be embraced by a human being. He considered it to be his fate to love a heavenly body without any hope of fulfillment and out of this insight he constructed an entire philosophy of renunciation and silent, faithful suffering that would improve and purify him. Yet all his dreams reached the planet. Once he stood again on the high cliff at night by the sea and gazed at the planet and burned with love for it. And at the height of his longing he leaped into the emptiness toward the planet, but at the instant of leaping "it's impossible" flashed once more through his mind. There he lay on the shore, shattered. He had not understood how to love. If at the instant of leaping he had had the strength of faith in the fulfillment of his love he would have soared into the heights and been united with the star. [Hermann Hesse, Demian]
- I can resist everything except temptation. [Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere's Fan - Act I]
- Let us do our best, even if it gets us nowhere. [Henry Miller]
- A little tap on the window pane, as though something had struck it, followed by a plentiful light falling sound, as of grains of sand being sprinkled from a window overhead, gradually spreading, intensifying, acquiring a regular rhythm, becoming fluid, sonorous, musical, immeasurable, universal: it was the rain. [Marcel Proust, Swann's Way]
- We have no need for genius - genius is dead. We have need for strong hands, for spirits who are willing to give up the ghost and put on flesh... [Henry Miller, Tropic of Cancer]
- Today I am proud to say that I am inhuman, that I belong not to men and governments, that I have nothing to do with creeds and principles. I have nothing to do with the creaking machinery of humanity-I belong to the earth! [Henry Miller, Tropic of Cancer]
- The cancer of time is eating us away. [Henry Miller, Tropic of Cancer]
- Do anything, but let it produce joy. Do anything, but let it yield ecstasy. [Henry Miller, Tropic of Cancer]
- Half the harm that is done in this world is due to people who want to feel important. They don't mean to do harm; but the harm does not interest them. Or they do not see it, or they justify it because they are absorbed in the endless struggle to think well of themselves. [T. S. Eliot, The Cocktail Party]
- Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured. [Mark Twain]
