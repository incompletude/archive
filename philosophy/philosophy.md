## Quotes

- My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it. [Friedrich Nietzsche, Aphorism]
- The oldest, the first, and the most basic monster.
- He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee. [Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil]
